# Wifi Deauth Implementation and Prevention   
The WiFi Deauthenticator project focuses on exposing vulnerabilities in wireless networks by creating a tool that sends deauthentication frames to forcibly disconnect devices from a WiFi network. Using flaws in the IEEE 802.11 protocol, the deauthenticator performs a type of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack without needing to crack network passwords. This project serves as a practical demonstration of how unsecured or poorly configured networks can be easily disrupted.
It emphasizes the importance of wireless security measures like WPA2/WPA3 encryption, network monitoring, and intrusion detection systems. Built using ESP8266 module, this project not only educates about ethical hacking and penetration testing but also encourages the adoption of stronger wireless security practices.
